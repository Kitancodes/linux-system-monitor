- Top CPU-consuming process
- Recent system logs

### Enhanced Monitor (`enhanced-monitor.sh`)
- All basic monitor features
- Automatic logging with timestamps
- Disk and memory usage alerts (configurable thresholds)
- Formatted, colorized output
- Top 5 memory-intensive processes
- Log file: `system_monitor.log`

### Backup Script (`backup.sh`)
- Automated backup of monitoring scripts
- Timestamoed backup files
- Compressed tar.gz archives
- Creates backup directory automatically 

## Installation & Usage
